                    <p class="pt-3 pb-3">
                      The website speed makes the first impression about your
                      business. It’s essential to understand that you won’t get
                      a second chance when it comes to user experience. Low
                      website speed is one of the most frustrating things that
                      will turn people off about your resource.

                    <p>
                      High-performance websites results in high return visits,
                      low bounce rates, higher conversions, engagement, higher
                      ranks in organic search, and better user experience. Slow
                      websites will cost you money and damaged reputation. By
                      reducing the page load time you will positively impact
                      marketing and sales processes. You’ll get higher traffic
                      and attract more qualified leads that can be converted
                      into customers. In this article, we will give you
                      recommendations about how to improve your website
                      performance and page load time.

                    <h4>Importance of website speed optimization</h4>
                    <p>
                      Page load time is a web performance metric that shows the
                      time needed for a page to show on the user screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Let’s take a look at how the website speed optimization
                      influences the key factors of website success:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>conversion</li>
                      <li>visibility</li>
                      <li>usability</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Conversion.</strong> Website conversion is an
                      important factor in your business success, which means
                      getting your visitors to do what you want them to do. For
                      instance, they will buy your product, subscribe to
                      newsletters campaigns, register for a webinar, or download
                      a guide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The faster the page loads, the higher conversion rates
                      it’ll have. According to the Hubspot research, 1 second
                      delay means 7 percent reduction in conversions. For
                      instance, a page slowdown of 1 second could cost Amazon
                      $1.6 billion in sales each year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Visibility.</strong> The load time of your website
                      also influences how easily users can find your website.
                      Website speed is one of the factors that Google takes into
                      consideration when ranking sites. A low performing website
                      has a poor user experience and as a result gains less
                      promotion in search results. Since December 2017, the
                      Google search engine has started ranking also based on
                      mobile versions of pages, even for desktop searches. The
                      goal of this decision is to protect users from the
                      websites that have low performance and aren’t responsive
                      to all devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Usability.</strong> Website usability like website
                      page speed, load time, and website responsiveness to user
                      requests directly impacts customer loyalty. The better
                      your website performs, the more satisfied a user will be.
                      A great user experience is a way for building a large
                      customer base and a strong brand.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Ways to assess your website speed</h4>
                    <p>
                      Before starting your website speed optimization you should
                      determine your current loading time and define what slows
                      your site down. Then you should set your website
                      performance goals. The recommendation for page load time
                      in 2018 is to be under 3 seconds. According to the Google
                      research on the average mobile speed across industry
                      sectors, just a fraction of websites is close to their
                      recommended speed.
                    </p>
                    <div class="mx-auto">
                      <img
                        src="./assets/images/122.jpg"
                        alt=""
                        class="img-fluid"
                      />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      So, if you optimize your website speed to an acceptable
                      level, you will get a significant ranking advantage over
                      competitors.

                      The ways of website speed optimization listed in this
                      article are very different and sometimes the solution to
                      one problem can have the negative impact on another aspect
                      of your site. That’s why we recommend analyzing the
                      website speed after each change to determine what actions
                      deliver the best results.

                    <h4>Guidelines to speed up your website</h4>
                    <p>
                      Once you have tested the speed of your website, you can
                      start optimizing it. There are a lot of different ways to
                      make your website work faster and we created the list of
                      the most effective ones.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                      <span>1.</span> Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      A content delivery network is a set of web servers
                      distributed across various geographical locations that
                      provide web content to end users with regard to their
                      location. When you host the website on a single server,
                      all users requests are sent to the same hardware. For this
                      reason, the time needed to process each request increases.
                      On top of that, the load time increases when users are
                      physically far from the server. With CDN, user requests
                      are redirected to the nearest server. As a result, the
                      content is delivered to a user quicker and a website works
                      faster. This is a rather expensive, but quite effective
                      way to optimize the load time.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>2.</span> Move your website to a better host</h4>
                    <p>There are three possible types of hosting:</p>
                    <ul style="padding-left: 1rem">
                      <li>Shared hosting</li>
                      <li>Virtual Private Servers (VPS) hosting</li>
                      <li>Dedicated server</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      The most popular type of hosting that is used all over the
                      world is sharing hosting. That’s the cheapest way to get
                      your site online in a short time and for a low fee. It’s
                      essential to choose the fast web host to ensure better
                      optimization. With shared hosting, you share CPU, disk
                      space, and RAM with other sites that also use this server.
                      This is the main reason why shared hosting isn’t as fast
                      as VPS or a dedicated server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Virtual Private Servers</strong> and dedicated
                      servers are much faster. VPS uses multiple servers for
                      content distribution. Having VPS you share the server with
                      its other users and have your own part of the virtual
                      server where your configurations don’t influence other
                      clients. If your website has the average traffic or you
                      have the eCommerce site with traffic spikes in some
                      periods, VPS will be the optimal solution for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The most expensive hosting option is to use a dedicated
                      server which can be your own physical server. In this
                      case, you pay a server rent and hire a system
                      administrator to maintain it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another approach is to rent dedicated cloud resource from
                      AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google, or other public cloud
                      provider. Both approaches can also be combined into a
                      hybrid cloud that we discussed recently. With dedicated
                      servers, all resources belong only to you and you get the
                      full control of it. Cloud infrastructures can also add
                      unlimited and on-demand scalability under a number of
                      packages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Serverless architecture</strong> is yet another
                      option that removes maintenance and server set up
                      procedures altogether. Consider reading our separate
                      article covering serverless architecture specifics and
                      benefits.

                    <h4>
                      <span>3.</span> Optimize the size of images on your
                      website
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      Everyone loves eye-catching images. In the case of
                      successful eCommerce sites, images are the vital part. A
                      lot of photos, images, graphics on your product pages
                      improve engagement. The negative side of the image use is
                      that they are usually large files that slow down a
                      website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The best way to reduce the image size without compromising
                      its quality is to compress images using such tools as
                      ImageOptim, JPEGmini, or Kraken. The procedure may take a
                      bit of time but it’s worth it. Another way to reduce the
                      image size is to use the HTML responsive images attributes
                      that adjust image size based on user display properties.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>4.</span> Reduce the number of plugins</h4>
                    <p>
                      Plugins are common components of each website. They add
                      specific features suggested by third parties.
                      Unfortunately, the more plugins are installed, the more
                      resources are needed to run them. As a result, the website
                      works slower and also security issues can appear. As time
                      passes, the number of plugins grows, while some of them
                      may not be used anymore. We recommend checking out all the
                      plugins you have installed and deleting unnecessary ones.
                      First, run the performance tests on your page to find out
                      which plugins are slowing down your website. Not only does
                      the website speed depend on the number of installed
                      plugins but also on their quality. Try to avoid plugins
                      that load a lot of scripts and styles or generate a lot of
                      database queries. The best solution is to keep only the
                      necessary ones and ensure that they are kept up to date.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                      <span>5.</span> Minimize the number of JavaScript and CSS
                      files
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                      If your website contains a lot of JavaScript and CSS
                      files, it leads to a large number of HTTP requests when
                      your website visitors want to access particular files.
                      These requests are treated individually by visitor’s
                      browser and slow down the website work. If you reduce the
                      number of JavaScript and CSS files this will undoubtedly
                      speed up your website. Try to group all JavaScript into
                      one and also do so with all CSS files. This will reduce
                      the overall number of HTTP requests. There are a lot of
                      tools to minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files quickly.
                      For instance, you can use WillPeavy, Script Minifier, or
                      Grunt tools.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>6.</span> Use website caching</h4>
                    <p>
                      In case there are a lot of users accessing the page at one
                      time servers work slowly and need more time to deliver the
                      web page to each user. Caching is the process of storing
                      the current version of your website on the hosting and
                      presenting this version until your website is updated.
                      This means that the web page doesn’t render over and over
                      again for each user.Cached web page doesn’t need to send
                      database requests each time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The approaches to website caching depend on the platform
                      your website is developed on. For WordPress for instance,
                      you can use the following plugins: W3 Total Cache or W3
                      Super Cache. If you use VPS or a dedicated server, you can
                      also set up caching under your general settings. In the
                      case of the shared server, the website caching isn’t
                      usually available.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>7.</span> Implement Gzip Compression</h4>
                    <p>
                      Gzip Compression is an effective way to reduce the size of
                      files. It minimizes the HTTP requests and reduces the
                      server response time. Gzip compresses the files before
                      sending them to the browser. On the user side, a browser
                      unzips the files and presents the contents. This method
                      can work with all files on your website. You can enable
                      Gzip on your website by adding some lines of the code or
                      via a utility called gzip.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>8.</span> Database optimization in CMS</h4>
                    <p>
                      Database optimization is the an effective way to increase
                      performance. If you use a content management system (CMS)
                      packed with complex plugins, the database size increases
                      and your website works slower. For instance, the WordPress
                      CMS stores comments, blog posts, and other information
                      that take up a lot of data storage. Each CMS requires its
                      own optimization measures and also has a number of
                      specific plugins. For WordPress, for example, you may
                      consider WP-Optimize.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>9.</span> Reduce the use of web fonts</h4>
                    <p>
                      Web fonts have become very popular in website design.
                      Unfortunately, the use of web fonts has a negative impact
                      on the speed of page rendering. Web fonts add extra HTTP
                      requests to external resources. The following measures
                      will help you reduce the size of web font traffic:
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>10.</span> Detect 404 errors</h4>
                    <p>
                      A 404 error means that a “Page isn’t found”. This message
                      is provided by the hosting to browsers or search engines
                      when the accessed content of a page no longer exists. In
                      order to detect and correct a 404 error, you can use error
                      detection tools and plugins. As we mentioned, additional
                      plugins can negatively affect your website speed, so we
                      advise running the resource through external tools for
                      error detection. For instance, Xenu’s Link Sleuth, Google
                      Webmaster Tools (GWT), and 404 Redirected Plugin For
                      WordPress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once you’ve detected all 404 errors, you need to assess
                      the traffic that they generate. If these dead links no
                      longer bring any visits and thus never consume your server
                      resource, then you may leave them as they are. If these
                      pages still have some traffic coming, consider setting
                      redirects for external links and fixing the link addresses
                      for the internal ones.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>11.</span> Reduce redirects</h4>
                    <p>
                      Website redirects create additional HTTP requests which
                      negatively impact performance. We advise to keep them to a
                      minimum or eliminate them entirely. First, you should
                      identify all redirects on you page by running a site scan.
                      You can use Screaming Frog to quickly identify redirects.
                      Then you must check if they serve a necessary purpose and
                      leave only the critical ones.
                    </p>
                    <h4><span>12.</span> Use prefetching techniques</h4>
                    <p>
                      Prefetching entails reading and executing instructions
                      before a user initiates them. The technique is rather
                      common. It works well if you can anticipate user actions
                      and, for instance, load some content or links in advance.
                      Usually, modern browsers allow for prefetching by default
                      as they assume user behavior patterns. However, UX
                      specialists and engineers are more likely to understand
                      user behavior and make “hints” for browsers to do
                      prefetching work.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                      Currently, a typical user expects web pages to load less
                      than after 3 seconds. If you don’t meet this expectation
                      barrier, you lose a lot of website traffic and, as a
                      result, your revenue.
